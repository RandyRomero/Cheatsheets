### What's tuple? 

Tuple is an immutable series of elements. 
Therefore you cannot add or remove elements to/from it.
You also cannot change items in tuple by index.
But if the element is a list or dict, you can change its content since in tuple list or dict are just pointers.
Elements can be mutable or immutable (whereas in set there are can be only immutable elements)

### What is k sorted array?

answer
A k sorted array is an array where each element is at most k distances away from its target position in the sorted array. 

Examples:
{3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4}, k = 2 is k sorted array b because every element is at most 2 distance away
from its target position in the sorted array.

{13, 8, 10, 7, 15, 14, 12}, k = 3 is not a k sorted array because 13 is more than k = 3 distance away
from its target position in the sorted array.

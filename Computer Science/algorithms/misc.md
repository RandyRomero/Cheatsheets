### What is k sorted array?

answer
A k sorted array is an array where each element is at most k distances away from its target position in the sorted array. 

Examples:
{3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4}, k = 2 is k sorted array b because every element is at most 2 distance away
from its target position in the sorted array.

{13, 8, 10, 7, 15, 14, 12}, k = 3 is not a k sorted array because 13 is more than k = 3 distance away
from its target position in the sorted array.

### What does mean 'stable' sorting algorithm?

Stable sorting algorithms preserve the relative order of equal elements, 
while unstable sorting algorithms donâ€™t. In other words, stable sorting 
maintains the position of two equals elements relative to one another.

### Does stability of a sortding algorithm matter?

answer:

When you need to sort a bunch of numbers, stability doesn't matter at all.
Order of duplicate numbers won't change anything.

However, there is another case. 
Long story short: if you need to sort not a bunch of integers,
but a bunch of tuples by integers (like [('Mike', 12), ('Lisa', 9)]) and you want to preserve
original order (if, e.g., they were sorted alphabetically), you need a stable sort or you
will ruin previous order.

### What's ORM? 

Object-Relational Mapping is a programming technique that lets you manipulate data from a database using an 
object-oriented paradigm. Usually when people mention ORM they mean a library that lets them ditch away SQL language
and manipulate data in their database in a language of their choice.

### Pros and cons of using ORM

+ You can use your favourite language instead of SQL
+ You can abstract away database engine and easily switch between, let's say, MySQL and PostgreSQL
+ With your ORM library you can get nice extra functionality, for example migrations management

- If you are good at SQL, you'll probably write more optimized queries than ORM (Django ORM are notorious for some bad SQL),
  so you still have to learn SQL to make sure ORM doesn't do crazy stuff
- You have to learn how to use specific ORM every time you want to use a new one

### What do you need to define many-to-one relationship?

You need to specify Foreign key in your 'many' side of relationship to 'one' side of relationship

If you have Reporter who can have multiple articles, you put Foreign Key in Article model that (key) points to 
your Reporter model. Like this:

```python
from django.db import models

class Reporter(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return "%s %s" % (self.first_name, self.last_name)

class Article(models.Model):
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    pub_date = models.DateField()
    reporter = models.ForeignKey(Reporter, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.headline

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['headline']
```

### Create a new Article entry via Article model 

Having Reporter and Article relationship via Foreign Key 
(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/#many-to-one-relationships)

create an a new Article entry via Article model, tied to a existing reporter

```python
from datetime import date

reporter = Reporter.objects.filter(id=1).first()
if not reporter:
    return None

articles = Article.objects.create(headline='whatever', pud_date=date(2012, 1, 7), reporter=reporter)
```

### How to update ForeignKey? In other words, how to set a reporter for already existing article?

```python
article = Entry.objects.get(id=1)
reporter = Reporter.objects.get(id=1)
# your code here
```

answer:
Updating a ForeignKey field works exactly the same way as saving a normal field â€“ assign an object of the right type 
to the field in question

```python
article = Entry.objects.get(id=1)
reporter = Reporter.objects.get(id=1)

article.reporter = reporter
article.save()

# or
reporter.article_set.add(article)
```

new_article2.reporter  # <Reporter: John Smith>


# now both articles belong to the r reporter. How to connect new_article2 to the r2 reporter?
# your code here
```

answer


```python

new_article.reporter  # <Reporter: John Smith>
new_article2.reporter  # <Reporter: John Smith>

# there are two ways
r2.article_set.add(new_article2)
new_article2.reporter   # <Reporter: Paul Jones>

# or

### How does caching work for many-to-one relations?

Forward access to one-to-many relationships is cached the first time the related object is accessed. Subsequent 
accesses to the foreign key on the same object instance are cached. Example:

```python
e = Entry.objects.get(id=2)
print(e.blog)  # Hits the database to retrieve the associated Blog.
print(e.blog)  # Doesn't hit the database; uses cached version.
```

### How to get all the streets of a country?

Let's imagine you have these four models

```python
from django.db import models

class Country(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)

class City(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    country = models.ForeignKey(Country, related_name="cities")

class Dictrict(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    city = models.ForeignKey(City, related_name="districts")

class Street(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    district = models.ForeignKey(Dictrict, related_name="districts")
```

How to get all the streets of some country?
For example, you have country:
```python
germany = Country.objects.filter(name="Germany").first()
```

And you want to get a list of all the streets in this country. How would you do it?
To get all streets of a District would be stupidly easy, just 
```python
some_district = District.objects.filter(name="some_district").first()
some_district.streets.all()
```

But how to get all the streets of a Country?

answer
As easy as that:
```python
germany = Country.objects.filter(name="Germany").first()

Street.objects.filter(district__citry__country=germany)
```

## Leetcode 2418. Sort the People

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/

Level: easy (really)

You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. 
Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.


```
Example 1:
Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

Example 2:
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
Explanation: The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.
```

Constraints:

n == names.length == heights.length
1 <= n <= 103
1 <= names[i].length <= 20
1 <= heights[i] <= 105
names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
All the values of heights are distinct.

A template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    names: list[str]
    heights: list[int]
    output: list[str]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(names=["Mary","John","Emma"], heights=[180,165,170], output=["Mary","Emma","John"]),
    TestCase(names=["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights=[155,185,150], output=["Bob","Alice","Bob"]),
]


def get_sorted_names(names: list[str], heights: list[int]) -> list[str]:
    """

    """
    # your code here


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_sorted_names(test_case.names, test_case.heights)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output},"
        f"names: {test_case.names},"
        f"heights: {test_case.heights}")

print("success!")
```


answer:
There is no intricate solution here, to be frank.
Sort the list of pairs name-height, then return the list of only names.
Seems like its time complexity is 2n*logn, thereby just nlogn
Space complexity should be linear: O(3n) which is O(n) at the end.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    names: list[str]
    heights: list[int]
    output: list[str]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(names=["Mary","John","Emma"], heights=[180,165,170], output=["Mary","Emma","John"]),
    TestCase(names=["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights=[155,185,150], output=["Bob","Alice","Bob"]),

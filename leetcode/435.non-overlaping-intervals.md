## LeetCode: 435. Non-overlaping intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

Level: Medium

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


```
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 3:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

answer:

Hint: pay attention to the word 'minimum'. Because you don't have to just throw out all intervals if they overlapping,
you need to throw away intervals in such a way so you throw the minimun to get other intervals non-overlaping. So, when you compare
two intervals, you need to throw away the biggest one and leave the smallest one. In case of [[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]],
when you compare [1,100] and [1,11], you need to throw away [1,100] as it will overlap with the rest of intervals if you leave
it.

```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
intervals: {intervals}
"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    intervals: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(intervals=[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]], output=1),
    TestCase(intervals=[[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]], output=2),

    TestCase(intervals=[[1,100],[11,22],[1,11],[2,12]], output=2),
    TestCase(intervals=[[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[3,5],[4,6]], output=2),
]


def get_minimum_number_of_intervals(intervals: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    """Return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping."""
    intervals.sort(key=lambda i: i[0])

    counter = 0
    # We only need to remember the end of the previous interval to be able to compare it with the next interval
    last_end = intervals[0][1]

    for start, end in intervals[1:]:
        # we compare the end of the previous interval with the beginning of the next interval
        # in order to figure out are they overlapping or not
        if last_end <= start:
            # if they now, we just keep the end of the current interval to for the next iteration to compare
            # it with the next interval
            last_end = end
        else:
            # if the end of the previous interval is bigger than the beginning of the next interval,
            # that means that these intervals are overlapping and we want to delete one of them
            counter += 1
            # We want to delete the biggest interval of two overlaping intervals and leave the smallest one
            # because that's how we find the minimum number of intervals we need to throw away to make the 
            # rest of intervals non-overlaping
            last_end = min(end, last_end)

    return counter


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = get_minimum_number_of_intervals(test_case.intervals[:])
        assert result == test_case.output, error_msg.format(
            result=result,
            expected_result=test_case.output,
            intervals=test_case.intervals,
        )
    print("success")
```

I guess, the time complexity of this solution is O(n*logn), because we need to sort the input first. And then we just linearly compare all intervals.
Space complexity, I think, linear, as we constructing new array with non-overlaping intervals.

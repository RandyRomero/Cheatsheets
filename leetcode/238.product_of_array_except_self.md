## LeetCode: 238. Product of Array Except Self

Level: medium

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
nums: {nums}
"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 3, 4], output=[24,12,8,6]),
    TestCase(nums=[-1, 1, 0, -3, 3], output=[0,0,9,0,0]),
]


def get_product_except_self(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """Return an array where is every item is a product of all nums except the num by the current index."""
    # your code here

    return output
        

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = get_product_except_self(test_case.nums)
        assert result == test_case.output, error_msg.format(
            result=result,
            expected_result=test_case.output,
            nums=test_case.nums)
    print("success")
```

answer:

Unfortunately, the algorithm for this answer is far from straightforward and cannot be come up with by using
just general knowledge and common logic.
Basically, we want to precompute the product of all nums before and after the num in question - then multiply these
two products.
It seems like we need to have two extra lists for it. One for all product if we multiply numbers from left to right,
then another array for products if we multiply numbers from right to left.
However, our solution should be of constant space complexity, which means we can only create an output array,
but not extra arrays.
It turns out, we can use the output array itself for precomputing all of these products.
First, we precompute product for each list cell from left to right. Then, we traverse the nums list backwards,
also keeping a product of all numbers that we have encountered, but, when we put it to the output list, we
also multiply that product by the values that are already there.

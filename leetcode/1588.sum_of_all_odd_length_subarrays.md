## Leetcode 1588. Sum of All Odd Length Subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-odd-length-subarrays/

Level: easy (no, it's not)

Given an array of positive integers arr, return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays of arr.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

```
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,4,2,5,3]
Output: 58
Explanation: The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are:
[1] = 1
[4] = 4
[2] = 2
[5] = 5
[3] = 3
[1,4,2] = 7
[4,2,5] = 11
[2,5,3] = 10
[1,4,2,5,3] = 15
If we add all these together we get 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 15 = 58

Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are only 2 subarrays of odd length, [1] and [2]. Their sum is 3.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [10,11,12]
Output: 66
```

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
 

Could you solve this problem in O(n) time complexity?

a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    arr: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(arr=[1,4,2,5,3], output=58),
    TestCase(arr=[1,2], output=3),
    TestCase(arr=[10,11,12], output=66),
]

    """

    """
    # your code here


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_sum_of_subarrays(test_case.arr)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output},"
        f"arr: {test_case.arr}"
        )

print("success!")
```

answer:
If you don't know the approach, you are doomed.

If order to calculate the sum of all odd subarrays linearly,
we will calculate how many times each number appears in every possible 
odd subarray.

For that, we will first calculate how many times each number appears 
in every possible subarray, even and odd, then will will divide it 
by two and add 1 if the number of appearances was odd.

Okay, but how to calculate a number of appearances of each number
if every possible array?
The number of appearances of a number in every possible array
it the number of arrays that start with this number multiplied
by the number of arrays that end with this number.
And there is a formula to calculate that.

For example, we have an array [1,4,2,5,3]
There are five arrays that start with 1:
[1]
[1, 4]
[1, 4, 2]
[1, 4, 2, 5]
[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
And there is only one array that ends with 1:
[1]

There are four arrays that start with 4:
[4]
[4, 2]
[4, 2, 5]
[4, 2, 5, 3]
And two that ends with 4:
[1, 4]
[4]

And so on.
So, to calculate a number of subarrays that start from a particular
index we need just subtract the index from the length of the array.
len(arr) - i

To calculate a number of subarrays that end at a particular there
is formula: i + 1

So, to count how many times a number at a particular index 
appears in every possible subarray is (len(arr) - i) * (i + 1)

However, we are interested only in odd subarray, that are roughly
half of the subarrays in an array.
So we need to divide the number of appearances by two, but add 1
if the number of appearances was odd

Finally, when we now the number of appearances in every odd subarray
for every index, we need to multiply the number of appearances of that
index by the value of array[index] for every index and sum all of the results.

Good, but long explanation is here:

Leetcode 942: DI String Match

https://leetcode.com/problems/di-string-match/

Level: easy (not straighforward at all, but you can get the idea if you find the pattern observing the examples)

A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] 
can be represented as a string s of length n where:

s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and
s[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].
Given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. 
If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return any of them.


```
Example 1:
Input: s = "IDID"
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: s = "III"
Output: [0,1,2,3]

Example 3:
Input: s = "DDI"
Output: [3,2,0,1]
```

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either 'I' or 'D'.

a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    s: str
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(s="IDID", output=[0,4,1,3,2]),
    TestCase(s="III", output=[0, 1, 2, 3]),
    TestCase(s="DDI", output=[3, 2, 0, 1]),

]


def get_permutations(s: str) -> list[int]:
    """Get list of permutations."""
    pass

for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_permutations(test_case.s)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output}, "
            f"s: {test_case.s}"
            )


print("success!")
```

answer:
Basically, the algorithm is not difficult at all. All you need is go through the given array
and, if you encounter "I" (which is short for increase, I guess) you append the lowest available
number to the resulting array. If you encounter D (short for decrease), you append the highest
possible value to the resulting array. It doesn't matter what legth the string have, you 
are always going to end up with one value that wasn't appended to the list. No more, no less
than one. You just need to add it to the resulting array before returning it.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    s: str
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(s="IDID", output=[0,4,1,3,2]),
    TestCase(s="III", output=[0, 1, 2, 3]),
    TestCase(s="DDI", output=[3, 2, 0, 1]),

]


def get_permutations(s: str) -> list[int]:
    """Get list of permutations."""
    
    max_num = len(s)
    min_num = 0

    result = []
    for letter in s:
        if letter == "I":
            result.append(min_num)
            min_num += 1
        elif letter == "D":
            result.append(max_num)
            max_num -= 1

    return result + [min_num]


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_permutations(test_case.s)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output}, "
            f"s: {test_case.s}"
            )

print("success!")
```

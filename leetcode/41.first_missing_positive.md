## LeetCode: 41. First Missing Positive

Level: hard

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive

Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
```

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 0], output=3),
    TestCase(nums=[3,4,-1,1], output=2),
    TestCase(nums=[7,8,9,11,12], output=1),
]

def get_first_missing_positive(nums: str) -> set[int]:
    """Find the first missing positive integer."""
    # your code here
        
    return output


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = get_first_missing_positive(test_case.nums[:])
    assert (
        result == test_case.output
    ), f"actual_result: {result}, expected_result: {test_case.nums}, nums: {test_case.nums}"

print("success!")
```

answer
In order to find out what is the first missing integer, we basically need to check if the given array contains
first - 1 - the smallest possible integer ever, then 2, then 3 and so on. If we had a sorted array, it would be
easy. We can sort an array, but that would lead to time complexity of O(nlogn), which is worse than the one
we have been asked for - linear. Also, we should stay within constant space complexiy, which basically means
we cannot use extra memory. So, what can we do? We can use the given array itself as a hashmap.
We will go through an array from left to right, checking on each value. For example, we first encounter number
'3' - then we will go to the third index of an array and flip the sign of the value under this index from positive
to negative. So, the negative sign will be our mark that the number exists in the array.
So, the algoritm is this:
- first we will traverse the given array and change all negative numbers to zeros (cause we are not interested in negative
numbers at all, but we need to be able to mark numbers with negative signs).
- then, we will go throughout the given array, marking what numbers exists. However, we cannot change a sign of a zero. So,
  instead of zero we will put a negative number that is bigger than the length of the array
- then, we will go through a range of positive integers starting with 1, and check if each of them present in the array
How do we check? For example, we are checking if number '3' exists in the array. We will go to the index number three and
check whether the number here is positive or negative. If it if negative, the number exists (somewhere). If not, we return
the number because it is missing - we haven't marked it with the minus sign

from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 0], output=3),
    TestCase(nums=[3,4,-1,1], output=2),
    TestCase(nums=[7,8,9,11,12], output=1),
    TestCase(nums=[1], output=2),
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 3], output=4),
    TestCase(nums=[1, 1, 2, 3], output=4),
    TestCase(nums=[1, 1], output=2),
]

def get_first_missing_positive(nums: str) -> set[int]:
    """Find the first missing positive integer."""
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] < 0:
            nums[i] = 0

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        value = abs(nums[i])
        if not (0 < value <= len(nums)):
            continue
        value = value - 1

        if nums[value] == 0:
            nums[value] = -(len(nums) + 1)
        elif nums[value] > 0:
            nums[value] = nums[value] * -1
        # else we do nothing because if we encounter a negative number at this point that can only mean
        # that there are duplicates in our original array and we already marked this number with negative sign

    print(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] >= 0:
            return i+1

    # if we have an array like [1, 2, 3], that means that the first missing positive is 4
    return len(nums)

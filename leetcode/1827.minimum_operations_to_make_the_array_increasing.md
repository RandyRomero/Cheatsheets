Leetcode: 1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/

Level: easy (not rediculously easy though)

You are given an integer array nums (0-indexed). 
In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.

For example, if nums = [1,2,3], you can choose to increment nums[1] to make nums = [1,3,3].
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums strictly increasing.

An array nums is strictly increasing if nums[i] < nums[i+1] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. 
An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can do the following operations:
1) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,1,2].
2) Increment nums[1], so nums becomes [1,2,2].
3) Increment nums[2], so nums becomes [1,2,3].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,2,4,1]
Output: 14

Example 3:
Input: nums = [8]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
1 <= nums[i] <= 104


a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[1,1,1], output=3),
    TestCase(nums=[1,5,2,4,1], output=14),
    TestCase(nums=[8], output=0),
]


def get_operations_nums(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Get minimum number of operations that needed to make the given array strictly increaing.
    
    [1, 1, 1] -> [1, 2, 3] # 3 operations
    """
    pass


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_operations_nums(test_case.nums)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" nums: {test_case.nums}"
        )

print("success!")
```

answer:

A bit too obvious to explain anything. Basically, as we traverse the array from left to right,
we are keeping track of what would the previous number be if the array was strictly increasing.
Also, we sum up the difference between the current number and what it whould be if the array
was strictly increasing.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[1,1,1], output=3),
    TestCase(nums=[1,5,2,4,1], output=14),
    TestCase(nums=[8], output=0),
]


def get_operations_nums(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Get minimum number of operations that needed to make the given array strictly increaing.
    
    [1, 1, 1] -> [1, 2, 3] # 3 operations
    """

    ops_counter = 0
    previous = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num <= previous:
            previous += 1
            ops_counter += previous - num
        else:
            previous = num
    return ops_counter

for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_operations_nums(test_case.nums)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" nums: {test_case.nums}"
        )

print("success!")
```

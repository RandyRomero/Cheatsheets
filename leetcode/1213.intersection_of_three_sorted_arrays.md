## Leetcode 1213: Intersection of Three Sorted Arrays

Level: easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-three-sorted-arrays/

Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order,
return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

```
Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

Example 2:
Input: arr1 = [197,418,523,876,1356], arr2 = [501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3 = [521,682,1337,1395,1764]
Output: []
```

Constraints:

1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000

a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    arr1: list[int]
    arr2: list[int]
    arr3: list[int]
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(arr1=[1,2,3,4,5], arr2=[1,2,5,7,9], arr3=[1,3,4,5,8], output=[1, 5]),
    TestCase(arr1=[197,418,523,876,1356], arr2=[501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3=[521,682,1337,1395,1764], output=[]),
]


def get_intersections(arr1: list[int], arr2: list[int], arr3: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Get list of numbers that belong to all the three given arrars."""
    pass


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_intersections(test_case.arr1, test_case.arr2, test_case.arr3)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output}, "
            f"arr1: {test_case.arr1}, "
            f"arr2: {test_case.arr2}, "
            f"arr3: {test_case.arr3}"
            )


print("success!")
```

answer:

There are at least three ways to solve this.

### Counting occurences with a hashmap
For example, we can count all the numbers with a hashmap, add
to a new array only numbers that we have encountered three times,
then go over any of array and if the number of occurences of this number
equals 3 - add the number to the array, so you don't even have to sort the
resulting array

However, it will take time and memory to create a hashmap, then go over a list again

### Three pointers
We can go over the given array only ones and do not use any memory at all. We can
define three pointers (p1, p2, p3), and go over the three arrays from left to right.

If arr1[p1] == arr2[p2] == arr3[p3] then you need to add this value to the resulting array
and increment all pointers.
If they are not equal, you need to increment the pointer that points to the smallest one
of the three arrays.

That would be O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

### Binary search
You can also, of course, check with binary search if a value from the first array
belongs to the second and third array, but it is not optimal solution for reasons
I failed to figure out


```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    arr1: list[int]
    arr2: list[int]
    arr3: list[int]
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(arr1=[1,2,3,4,5], arr2=[1,2,5,7,9], arr3=[1,3,4,5,8], output=[1, 5]),
    TestCase(arr1=[197,418,523,876,1356], arr2=[501,880,1593,1710,1870], arr3=[521,682,1337,1395,1764], output=[]),
]


def get_intersections(arr1: list[int], arr2: list[int], arr3: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Get list of numbers that belong to all three given arrars."""
    p1, p2, p3 = 0, 0, 0

    result = []

    try:
        while True:
            if arr1[p1] == arr2[p2] == arr3[p3]:
                result.append(arr1[p1])
                p1 += 1
                p2 += 1
                p3 += 1
                continue

            if arr1[p1] < arr2[p2]:
                p1 += 1
            elif arr2[p2] < arr3[p3]:
                p2 += 1
            else:
                p3 += 1
    except IndexError:
        return result


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_intersections(test_case.arr1, test_case.arr2, test_case.arr3)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output}, "
            f"arr1: {test_case.arr1}, "
            f"arr2: {test_case.arr2}, "
            f"arr3: {test_case.arr3}"
            )


print("success!")
```

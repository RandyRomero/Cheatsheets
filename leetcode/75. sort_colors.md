### 75. Sort colors

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, 
sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```

Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
test nums: {nums},
"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    expected_result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0], expected_result=[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]),
    TestCase(nums=[2, 0, 1], expected_result=[0, 1, 2]),
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 0], expected_result=[0, 1, 2]),
]


def sort_colors(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    # your code here
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = sort_colors(test_case.nums)
        assert result == test_case.expected_result, error_msg.format(
            result=result,
            expected_result=test_case.expected_result,
            nums=test_case.nums,
        )
    print("success!")
```

answer

There can be several approaches.

First - sort the array with some kind of merge sort or something.
However, that would take O(nlogn) time complexity

Second - use countring sort. However, it will take two passes (one for
counting and one to insert counted numebers back to the original array)

Third - use an algorithm from Dutch National Flag problem suggested by Dijkstra.
It only works for arrays of three unique elements, but it take only one pass
to sort the array and constant space complexity.
The key to this solution is to use three pointers and swap values between
a mid pointer and two others. You can read more about that here:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/
or here in more details:

Basically, we form three groups of numbers and disribute these
numbers between the groups.


```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
test nums: {nums},
"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    expected_result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0], expected_result=[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]),
    TestCase(nums=[2, 0, 1], expected_result=[0, 1, 2]),
    TestCase(nums=[1, 2, 0], expected_result=[0, 1, 2]),
]


def sort_colors(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Sort three unique colours

    - O(n) time complexity
    - O(1) space complexity
    """
    left = 0
    mid = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while mid <= right:
        if nums[mid] < 1:
            nums[left], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[left]
            left += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] > 1:
            nums[right], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[right]
            right -= 1
        else:
            mid += 1

    return nums


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = sort_colors(test_case.nums)
        assert result == test_case.expected_result, error_msg.format(
            result=result,
            expected_result=test_case.expected_result,
            nums=test_case.nums,
        )
    print("success!")
```

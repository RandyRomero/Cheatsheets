## LeetCode: 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-visible-people-in-a-queue/

Level: Hard (acutally more like medium)

There are n people standing in a queue, and they numbered from 0 to n - 1 in left to right order. 
You are given an array heights of distinct integers where heights[i] represents the height of the ith person.

A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. 
More formally, the ith person can see the jth person if i < j and min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1]).

Return an array answer of length n where answer[i] is the number of people the ith person can see to their right in the queue.

```
Example 1:
Input: heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]
Output: [3,1,2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
Person 0 can see person 1, 2, and 4.
Person 1 can see person 2.
Person 2 can see person 3 and 4.
Person 3 can see person 4.
Person 4 can see person 5.
Person 5 can see no one since nobody is to the right of them.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,10]
Output: [4,1,1,1,0]
```

All the values of heights are **unique**.

Template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    """Test case."""

    heights: list[int]
    result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(heights=[10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9], result=[3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]),
    TestCase(heights=[5, 1, 2, 3, 10], result=[4, 1, 1, 1, 0]),
]


def find_number_of_visible_people(heights: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Find number of visible people in a queue."""
    pass


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = find_number_of_visible_people(test_case.heights)
    assert result == test_case.result, (
        f"actual_result: {result}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.result}, " f"heights: {test_case.heights}",
    )

print("success!")
```

answer:

Here is a perfect usecase for Monotonic stack.
We will traverse the list from the end to the beginning, adding all values
to the stack no matter what.
Than we need to compare the current height with the last value in a stack (which is usually
the previous heigh, or heights[i+1]). If current_heigh is bigger than the last value in a stack,
we increase a counter by one and pop this value. We proceed in the same way until we find
a value in the stack that is bigger the the current_height. Counter will be the number of people
we can see from the current position. Popping values from stacks will be useful for every position,
because we can't see any values that are shorter than some value anyway.

For example, we have heights [10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9]. We we move from 8 to 11, we can see 5
and 11, but we pop 5 as it is lower than 8. Than, when we start with 10 and will traverse
to 11, we don't need 5 as it is blocked by 8. So deleting it for 8 was also right thing
for 10.



```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    """Test case."""

    heights: list[int]
    result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(heights=[10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9], result=[3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]),
    TestCase(heights=[5, 1, 2, 3, 10], result=[4, 1, 1, 1, 0]),
]


def find_number_of_visible_people(heights: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Find number of visible people in a queue."""
    len_heights = len(heights)
    stack: list[int] = []
    output = [0] * len_heights
    for i in range(len_heights - 1, -1, -1):
        current_height = heights[i]
        num = 0
        while stack and current_height > stack[-1]:
            num += 1
            stack.pop()
        if stack and current_height < stack[-1]:
            num += 1

        output[i] = num
        stack.append(current_height)
    return output


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = find_number_of_visible_people(test_case.heights)
    assert result == test_case.result, (
        f"actual_result: {result}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.result}, " f"heights: {test_case.heights}",
    )

print("success!")
```

I don't know for sure the **time complexity** of this algorithm, but I guess
it should be less than quadratic as we pop a lot of unnecessary numbers
and most of them are never seen more than twice. So I guess it's got to be
linear.

As to space complexity, it would be at least linear since we create a totally new
output that is of the same length as the original array. Also we add some values
to the stack, but we elminate a lot of them, so it shouldn't use too much of a memory.

## Leetcode 1913: Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs

Level: easy

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-difference-between-two-pairs/

The product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).

For example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.
Given an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product 
difference between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.

Return the maximum such product difference.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 34
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) 
and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]
Output: 64
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) 
and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.
```

4 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

a template:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[5,6,2,7,4], output=34),
    TestCase(nums=[4,2,5,9,7,4,8], output=64),
]


def get_max_product_difference(nums: str) -> list[int]:
    # your code here
    


for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_max_product_difference(test_case.nums)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" arr: {test_case.nums}"
        )

print("success!")
```


answer:
You can solve it in  O(n) time.
First of all, the whole point of the task is to find the two biggest
numbers and the two smallest numbers. In order to do it, you can sort
the array, but that would be O(nlogn). Instead, we can find all
the numbers we want in just one linear pass. What you need is to
traverse the array from left to right and keep track of min and max values
and min2, max2 values. It easier to show the code than the to explain it briefly
in words, so there is the code: 

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[5,6,2,7,4], output=34),
    TestCase(nums=[4,2,5,9,7,4,8], output=64),
]


def get_max_product_difference(nums: str) -> list[int]:
    ""# your code here""
    min1, min2 = 10 ** 4, 10 ** 4  # the biggest possible number due constaints
    max1, max2 = 0, 0  # the smallest possible number by constraint

    for num in nums:
        if num < min1:
            min1, min2 = num, min1
        elif num < min2:
            min2 = num

        if num > max1:
            max1, max2 = num, max1
        elif num > max2:
            max2 = num
    return (max2 * max1) - (min2 * min1)



for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_max_product_difference(test_case.nums)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" arr: {test_case.nums}"
        )

print("success!")
```

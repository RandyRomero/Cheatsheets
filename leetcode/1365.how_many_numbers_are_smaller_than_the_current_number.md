## Leetcode 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

Level: easy (my ass it is easy)

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.


```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
```

Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100

    TestCase(nums=[6,5,4,8], output=[2,1,0,3]),

answer:

In order to find the number of elements that is smaller than the current element,
it would really help us to sort the nums list beforehand. If the list is sorted,
all elements to the left of the element is smaller than it. So we need to sort an
array.

However, we also need to take into account that there can be not unique elements.
What does take into account the number of not unique elements while sorting? That's
right, counting sort.

Take a look at constrainst again:
2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100

We know that the max number in the array is pretty small, so that's another hint
to use the counting sort. However, we only need to count all occurences of
all numbers and than calculate their running sum. For example, we have our array
like this:

nums = [8,1,2,2,3,5,2,6,1,5]
the counting array would look like [0, 2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1]
(also, we need to start with 0 every time, or it won't work)
So what?
Let's look at this counting array from another perspective
This is the same as: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8]
First, now the array is sorted and we can see, for example,
there are 9 values to the left from 8, or, in other words,
less then 8. We cannot use such an array, it's just to show
you what running sum array represents.
The actual running sum array would look like this: [0, 2, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 10]
Having this array, we can take go back to our original array, take any value,
use this value as an index to this running sum array. For example,
we take the 5th element from [8,1,2,2,3,5,2,6,1,5] which is 3,
use it is an index in running sum array, go to that index, go one value
to the left of this index, which gives us value 5. That's all - there are 
5 elements that are less than number 3 in the original array (they are 1,1,2,2,2)

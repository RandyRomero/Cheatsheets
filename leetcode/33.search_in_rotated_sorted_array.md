## LeetCode: 53. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Level: medium

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/


There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    target: int
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[5,1,2,3,4], target=1, output=1),
    TestCase(nums=[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target=0, output=4),
    TestCase(nums=[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target=3, output=-1),
    TestCase(nums=[1], target=0, output=-1),
    TestCase(nums=[3,1], target=1, output=1),
]

def search_in_sorted_rotated_array(nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """Return the index of a target if it is in the nums, otherwise return -1."""

    # your code here
   


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = search_in_sorted_rotated_array(test_case.nums[:], test_case.target)
    assert (
        result == test_case.output
    ), f"actual_result: {result}, expected_result: {test_case.output}, nums: {test_case.nums}, target: {test_case.target}"

print("success!")
```

answer:

Explanation:
We cannot just check one value by one going left to right, because we are asked
to find a solution with O(logn) time complexity.
Search with with O(logn) time complexity sounds like a Binary search, however,
we cannot use Binary Search with an array that is not sorted.

Here is a solution that is a bit similar to Binary Search, but it is not. In Binary
Search you compare the middle of your array to the target value, and throuh a half of the
array that definitely does no contain target value. You know, for example, that
if your middle value is 10, and your target is 12, anything less than ten cannot contain
your target number.

Here it is a bit similar. First of all, in a sorted rotated array at one half of it is always
sorted. So we can check whether it contains our target value without going linearly throughout
this half of the array. In other words, what we need to  do first, is to find which half
of the array is sorted.

When you found sorted one, you check whether your target value could be part of this smaller array.
If yes, you just proceed recursively until your middle value is your target value.
However, what if our value doesn't belong to the sorted part of the array? We do the same!
We still divide find a middle of this unsorted array and still firgure out which part is
sorted and whether the target number belongs to this sorted part.

I found this illustration of iterations of the algorithm to be useful:
```
[4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,0,1,2] target = 11

mid = 10 

[11,12,0,1,2]

mid = 0

[11, 12, 0]

mid = 12

[11, 12]

mid = 11 
```

So, in a nutshell, first we check which part if sorted. Then - does the target belong to
this sorted part (cause we can only do it quickly in with sorted part). Either way, we keep
only the part of an array that has the target (by checking whether it is in sorted part we eliminate the
need to check in is the unsorted part where to check it would be much slower). By constantly checking to which of part
of the array the target belongs and cutting the array in half, sooner or later our middle pointer steps on our target
value. Otherwise, we return -1.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums: list[int]
    target: int
    output: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(nums=[5,1,2,3,4], target=1, output=1),
    TestCase(nums=[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target=0, output=4),
    TestCase(nums=[4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target=3, output=-1),
    TestCase(nums=[1], target=0, output=-1),
    TestCase(nums=[3,1], target=1, output=1),
]

def search_in_sorted_rotated_array(nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """Return the index of a target if it is in the nums, otherwise return -1."""

    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]: # means that the left part of the array is sorted
            if nums[left] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        else:
            if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

    return -1
   


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = search_in_sorted_rotated_array(test_case.nums[:], test_case.target)
    assert (
        result == test_case.output
    ), f"actual_result: {result}, expected_result: {test_case.output}, nums: {test_case.nums}, target: {test_case.target}"

print("success!")

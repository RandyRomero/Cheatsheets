## LeetCode: 739.Daily Temperatures

https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Level: Medium

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

```
Example 1:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Example 2:
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]

Example 3:
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

Template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    temperatures: list[int]
    result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(
        temperatures=[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], result=[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
    ),
    TestCase(temperatures=[30, 40, 50, 60], result=[1, 1, 1, 0]),
    TestCase(temperatures=[30, 60, 90], result=[1, 1, 0]),
]


def find_daily_temperatures(temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    pass

for test_case in test_cases:
    result = find_daily_temperatures(test_case.temperatures)
    assert (
        result == test_case.result
    ), (f"actual_result: {result}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.result},"
        f"temperatures: {test_case.temperatures}")

print("success!")
```

answer:

Basically, the problem is about finding the next great value.
Brutforce solution as usuall would be far from eficient - O(n^2)
Instead, we can use a Monotonic stack. It would require O(n) time,
but its space complexity would be O(n) too because we create a new array. Also, 
we need extra space for the stack. 

We can do better than this and without any additional stack. And the solution
is rather simple. We just need to traverse the given array from the right, put results
(days) to the output array and also use this output array to find the next warmer day.

How is so?
Let's take these temperature as an example `[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`, but
for the sake of example start from the 75. We check the next value, 71, and it is less than 75. So should we check next - 69? Not really. Because we already now, if we traverse
the temperatures from the right, that it takes 2 days two get warmer after it is 71.
So, we skip 69 and go to the next value that is greater than 71 - 72. Which is also
less than 75. We check again how many days it takes to get warmer after it is 72 - one day. We check 75 agaist the next value - finally we found 76. And the result for 75 would be sum of all days we used as an offset. It was 1 to 71, then 2 to 72, then again 1 to 76 which gives us 4 - and we put 4 to the output array by the same index 75 has in the given array.  

Here is the code:


```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    temperatures: list[int]
    result: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(
        temperatures=[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], result=[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
    ),
    TestCase(temperatures=[30, 40, 50, 60], result=[1, 1, 1, 0]),
    TestCase(temperatures=[30, 60, 90], result=[1, 1, 0]),
]


def find_daily_temperatures(temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """
    Find next greater temperature.
    
    Accepts a list of temperatures and returns a list of integers where every
    integers show the number of days before it gets warmer.
    """
    len_temperatures = len(temperatures)
    hottest = 29
    output = [0] * len_temperatures

    for current_day in range(len_temperatures - 1, -1, -1):
        current_temperature = temperatures[current_day]
        if current_temperature > hottest:
            hottest = current_temperature
            continue

        days = 1
        while current_temperature >= temperatures[current_day + days]:
            days += output[current_day + days]
        output[current_day] = days

    return output


for test_case in test_cases:
    result = find_daily_temperatures(test_case.temperatures)
    assert (
        result == test_case.result
    ), (f"actual_result: {result}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.result},"
        f"temperatures: {test_case.temperatures}")

print("success!")
```

Time complexity is O(n). The nested while loop makes this algorithm look worse than O(n). However, same as in the first approach, the total number of iterations in the while loop does not exceed n, which gives this algorithm a time complexity of O(2 * n) = O(n).

Space complexity is O(n) because we create a new array

Leetcode: 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors

https://leetcode.com/problems/dot-product-of-two-sparse-vectors/

Level: medium

Given two sparse vectors, compute their dot product.

Implement class SparseVector:

SparseVector(nums) Initializes the object with the vector nums
dotProduct(vec) Compute the dot product between the instance of SparseVector and vec
A sparse vector is a vector that has mostly zero values, 
you should store the sparse vector efficiently and compute the dot product between two SparseVector.


```
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,0,0,2,3], nums2 = [0,3,0,4,0]
Output: 8
Explanation: v1 = SparseVector(nums1) , v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
v1.dotProduct(v2) = 1*0 + 0*3 + 0*0 + 2*4 + 3*0 = 8
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,0,0], nums2 = [0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: v1 = SparseVector(nums1) , v2 = SparseVector(nums2)
v1.dotProduct(v2) = 0*0 + 1*0 + 0*0 + 0*0 + 0*2 = 0
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0,1,0,0,2,0,0], nums2 = [1,0,0,0,3,0,4]
Output: 6
```

Constraints:
n == nums1.length == nums2.length
1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100

answer:
It is easy to store a sparce vector efficiently - you just convert it
to a dict where index is a key, and the value is the value. Everything
that is not in array you assume to be equal to zero.
That is what you do on vector initialization.


In dot_product method you go over every existing element.
You don't have to go over assumed 0's causes multiplying
by zero gives zero therefore doesn't change the resulting
sum

If a number, that exists in given vector, doesn't
exist in another one, we just skip it, because
it means that it is zero and once again
zero doesn't change the resulting sum

Then you just calculate the dot product using the formula from the
description.

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    nums1: list[int]
    nums2: list[int]
    output: int

Let n be the length of the input array and L be the number of non-zero elements.

Time complexity: O(n) for creating the Hash Map; O(L) for calculating the dot product.

Space complexity: O(L) for creating the Hash Map, as we only store elements that are non-zero. 
O(1) for calculating the dot product.

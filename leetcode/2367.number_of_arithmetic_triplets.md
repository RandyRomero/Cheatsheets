## Leetcode: 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/

Level: easy (I doubt it)

You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.
```

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 200
0 <= nums[i] <= 200
1 <= diff <= 50
nums is strictly increasing.

It is possible to solve it with time complexity: O(n) and the same space complexity

    output = get_list(test_case.nums, test_case.diff)

        output == test_case.output
    ), (f"actual_result: {output}",

print("success!")
```

answer:
Basically, for every given num we check if there is a triplet that ends with this num.
To get the best possible time complexity, we add every num as we go to the `seen` set.
Then, for every num we check if num - diff exists in the `seen` and num - diff * 2 exists
in the `seen`. For example, if the num is 7 and diff is 3, then we check wether there are
4 and 1 in the given array of nums.

## LeetCode: 121. Best time to buy and sell stock

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Level: Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
test case: {input}"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    input: list[int]
    result: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(input=[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4], result=5),
    TestCase(input=[7, 6, 4, 3, 1], result=0),
]


def calculate_profit(stock_prices: list[int]) -> int:
    """Calculate maximum possible profit."""
    # your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = calculate_profit(test_case.input)
        assert result == test_case.result, error_msg.format(
            result=result, expected_result=test_case.result, input=test_case.input
        )
    print("success!")
```

There can be different approaches. However, simple one is this:

We need to traverse the given array of integers linearly and find
- the minimum price
- the maximum profit we can make

```python
import typing as tp

error_msg = """
actual_result: {result},
expected_result: {expected_result},
test case: {input}"""


class TestCase(tp.NamedTuple):
    input: list[int]
    result: int


test_cases = [
    TestCase(input=[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4], result=5),
    TestCase(input=[7, 6, 4, 3, 1], result=0),
]


def calculate_profit(stock_prices: list[int]) -> int:
    """Calculate maximum possible profit."""
    min_price = int(1e9)
    max_profit = 0

    for i in range(len(stock_prices)):
        min_price = min(min_price, stock_prices[i])
        max_profit = max(max_profit, stock_prices[i] - min_price)

    return max_profit


if __name__ == "__main__":
    for test_case in test_cases:
        result = calculate_profit(test_case.input)
        assert result == test_case.result, error_msg.format(
            result=result, expected_result=test_case.result, input=test_case.input
        )
    print("success!")
```

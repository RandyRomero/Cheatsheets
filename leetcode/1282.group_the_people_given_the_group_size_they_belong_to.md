## Leetcode: 1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to/

Level: Medium

There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. 
Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.

You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is 
the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3,
then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.

Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. 
If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will 
be at least one valid solution for the given input.

```
Example 1:
Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
Explanation: 
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].

Example 2:
Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
```

Constraints:
groupSizes.length == n
1 <= n <= 500
1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n

a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    groupSizes: list[int]
    output: list[list[int]]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(groupSizes=[3,3,3,3,3,1,3], output=[[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]),
    TestCase(groupSizes=[2,1,3,3,3,2], output=[[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]),
]


def get_groups(groupSizes: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Redistribute people by groups."""
    # your code here

for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_groups(test_case.groupSizes)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output},"
            f"nums: {test_case.groupSizes}"
            )


print("success!")
```

answer:
First, we will group people by a size of a group they are in.
For this purpose, we will use a dict where the key is a size of a
group and a value is a list of all indexes of people who should
be in a group of that size.
For the first test case with input of [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
a corresponding dict would look like
{1: [5], 3: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]}

Now we have people grouped by the size of their groups,
we need only spread them across lists of the groupSize size evenly


```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    groupSizes: list[int]
    output: list[list[int]]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(groupSizes=[3,3,3,3,3,1,3], output=[[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]),
    TestCase(groupSizes=[2,1,3,3,3,2], output=[[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]),
]


def get_groups(groupSizes: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Redistribute people by groups."""

    counter = defaultdict(list)
    for i, group_size in enumerate(groupSizes):
        counter[group_size].append(i)

    output = []
    for group_size, idxs in counter.items():
        for i in range(0, len(idxs), group_size):
            output.append(idxs[i:i+group_size])

    return output

for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_groups(test_case.groupSizes)
    for inner_list in test_case.output:
        assert inner_list in output, (
            f"actual_result: {output}",
            f"expected_result: {test_case.output},"
            f"nums: {test_case.groupSizes}"
            )


print("success!")
```

I believe that the time complexity is O(2n),
because you need two traverse all the numbers twice.
Also, the space complexity also should be O(2n),
because first we create a dict with all numbers,
then we create a new list with all the nummbers.

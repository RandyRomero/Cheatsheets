## Leetcode 1769: Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box

Level: medium

You have n boxes. You are given a binary string boxes of length n,
where boxes[i] is '0' if the ith box is empty, and '1' if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box.
Box i is adjacent to box j if abs(i - j) == 1. Note that after doing so,
there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum number of 
operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box.

Each answer[i] is calculated considering the initial state of the boxes.

```
Example 1:
Input: boxes = "110"
Output: [1,1,3]
Explanation: The answer for each box is as follows:
1) First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.
2) Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.
3) Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, 
and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.

Example 2:
Input: boxes = "001011"
Output: [11,8,5,4,3,4]
```
 
 Constraints:
n == boxes.length
1 <= n <= 2000
boxes[i] is either '0' or '1'.

a template:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    boxes: str
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(boxes="110", output=[1, 1, 3]),
    TestCase(boxes="001011", output=[11,8,5,4,3,4]),
]


def get_minimum_operations_num(boxes: str) -> list[int]:
    # your code here



for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_minimum_operations_num(test_case.boxes)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" arr: {test_case.boxes}"
        )

print("success!")
```

answer:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class TestCase(NamedTuple):
    boxes: str
    output: list[int]


test_cases = [
    TestCase(boxes="110", output=[1, 1, 3]),
    TestCase(boxes="001011", output=[11,8,5,4,3,4]),
]


def get_minimum_operations_num(boxes: str) -> list[int]:
    left_balls = 0  # num of balls to the left of the current idx
    right_balls = 0  # num of balls to the right of the current idx
    steps = 0  # steps to move all the balls to the current idx

    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):
        if box == '1':
            right_balls += 1  # num of balls to the right of the very first idx
            steps += i  # num of steps to move all the balls to the very first idx

    result = [0] * len(boxes)  # resulting array
    for i, box in enumerate(boxes):
        result[i] = steps

        # if we move from left to right and encounter a box with a ball, the number of balls
        # to the left increases, to the right - decreases
        if box == '1':
            right_balls -= 1
            left_balls += 1
            
        # for every next index the number of steps to move each ball increases by a sum of ball to
        # the left and decreases by the sum of ball to the right
        steps += left_balls
        steps -= right_balls

    return result



for test_case in test_cases:
    output = get_minimum_operations_num(test_case.boxes)
    assert (
        output == test_case.output
    ), (
        f"actual_result: {output}",
        f"expected_result: {test_case.output}," 
        f" arr: {test_case.boxes}"
        )

print("success!")
```

Time complexity is O(n)
Space complexity is O(n)

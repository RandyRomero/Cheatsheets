### What is High Availability?

answer:

Your ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of failure and/or ensure a certain level of performance

question id: 0d3653e0-ee36-474a-9cf8-06fc2a40df52


### How can you achieve High Availability?

answer:

Running your workload across multiple Availability Zones ensures that if 1 or 2 AZs become unavailable your service/applications remain available.

### How can High Availability be implemented on AWS?

answer:

Using Elastic Load Balancer would assist in implementing High Availability

question id: ae053e2b-8ed6-42b7-b4ff-db9d4f4133b2


### Why would you need Elastic Load Balancer?

answer:

A load balancer allows you to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or more data center. If a data center or server becomes unavailable (unhealthy) the load balancer will route the traffic to only available data centers with servers.â€‹

### What are two types of scaling and what do they mean?

answer:

Vertical scaling - upgrade to more powerful server - and horizontal scaling - adding more of the same servers

### What's another term for vertical scaling?

answer:

scaling up

answer:

It's a vertical scaling - upgrade to a more powerful server

question id: 540487f5-acbc-41d3-afe5-a7cb89e0ef31


### What's another term for horizontal scaling?

answer:

scaling out

question id: c8df340b-b662-45b4-abed-d5223a7f8740


### What's scaling out?

answer:

It's another term for horizontal scaling - adding more of the same servers

question id: a811b47b-66ca-4b0c-91e0-e4c4c48db359


### What's a side benefit of horizontal scaling?

answer

By increasing an amount of servers you increase your availability

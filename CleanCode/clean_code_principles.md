### What principles of clean code do you use?

- readability over conciseness
- variable names should have clear meaning (say no to m, n, foo, bar, etc)
- DRY: do not repeat yourself (reuse code, do not copy paste it)
- KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid (The question to ask when you're writing code is "can this be written in a simpler way?")
- comment and keep comments updated
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It. A developer should not add functionality unless deemed necessary
- create functions that are small and do a single thing (part of SOLID)
- use things like xenon to avoid code complexity
- use types to make it clear what's what
- use linters to avoid a lot of mistakes
- use formatters such as black

There are possibly much more than that, but I guess it is enough for starters
